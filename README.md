# FinTechInClass1

Hi my name is Tony Hart, I am excited to be here this morning!

Along with this program I am also finishing up my undergraduate degree in Business Management at Portland State University. 

I hope to be able to learn valuable tools in order to do well in a career in FinTech. 

I chose FinTech because of the impact it is having in today's business environment. 

Hope everyone is having a great day so far!

# Hello!
